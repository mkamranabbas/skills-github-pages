4. Install Dependencies:

Use Bundler to install the project's dependencies (specified in the Gemfile.lock):

bundle install

5. Serve the Jekyll Site Locally:

You can now build and serve your Jekyll site locally for testing and development. Run the following command:

**
bundle exec jekyll serve

This command will build your site and start a local web server. You should see an output like:

6. Customize Your Jekyll Site:

    Configuration (_config.yml): Customize your site's settings, including title, description, base URL, and other configuration options, in the _config.yml file.

    Layouts: Create or modify layout files in the _layouts directory to control the overall structure of your site's pages.

    Content: Add your content in Markdown or HTML format to the _posts directory for blog posts or create new pages in the root directory. Front matter (YAML metadata) at the top of each Markdown file allows you to specify properties like layout, title, and date.

7. Customize Styles and Assets:

You can customize the styles and assets (CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) for your site. Depending on your preferences, you can link external stylesheets, use CSS frameworks, or create your own CSS files in the _sass directory.
